# WeatherApp

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate the use of third-party APIs. In this case, the API was a weather API. The technologies used inclue the API for openweathermap.org, as well as AJAX and local storage. Throughout this project I was able to learn how to utilize third-party APIs, use fetch requests and promises, and effeciently navigate documentation.

This project can be used to get a forecast of the local weather based on city. A specific city can be searched for, or a pre-selected city can quickly be searched by clicking on the corresponding button. This project not only shows the current weather but also a 5-day forecast. The information provided about the weather includes the temperature, wind, and humidity. An icon is displayed to convey the current weather - sun, rain, cloudy, etc.
